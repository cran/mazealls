\usage{
holey_path(unit_len, lengths, angles, draw_line = TRUE, has_hole = FALSE,
  hole_color = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{unit_len}{the unit length in graph coordinates. This controls
the width of the \sQuote{holes} in the boundary lines and
generally controls the spacing of mazes.}

\item{lengths}{an array of the number of units
each part of the path. An array of length \code{n}.}

\item{angles}{after each part of the path is
drawn, the turtle turns right by the given angle.}

\item{draw_line}{a boolean array telling whether
each part of the path is drawn at all, or whether
the turtle simply moves through that path.}

\item{has_hole}{a boolean array telling whether,
conditional on the path being drawn, it has a one unit
hole.}

\item{hole_color}{the color to plot the \sQuote{hole}. 
A value \code{NULL} or \code{'clear'} corresponds to no 
drawn hole, the latter being useful for mixing drawn colored
holes with no hole drawn at all (for which \code{'white'}
would be an acceptable choice if the background were white).
Filled holes are often useful for indicating the entry and
exit points of a maze.
See the \code{\link[grDevices]{colors}} function for
acceptable values.}
}
\value{
nothing; the function is called for side effects only, though in
the future this might return information about the drawn boundary of
the shape.
}
\description{
Make the turtle move multiple units, making turns, and possibly drawing
line segments possibly with holes in them.
}
\details{
Causes the turtle to move through a path of connected line segments,
possibly drawing lines, possibly drawing holes in those lines.
All arguments are recycled to the length of the longest
argument via \code{mapply}, which simplifies
the path description.
